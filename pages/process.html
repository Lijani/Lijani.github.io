                    <p>
                        Keeping the challenges in South Africa in mind, the initiative has been aimed at making it as simple
                        as possible - in the light of how it works, what happens afterward, and how to become a part of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole process can be divided into three sections:

                        <ul class="alt">
                            <li>- Registering as a waste picker.</li>
                            <li>- Processing the waste.</li>
                            <li>- Upcycling the waste.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Each section have been carefully thought through and the sub-processes within each has been considered carefully
                        to ensure maximum efficiency.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Becoming a registered waste picker</h2>
                    <p>
                        An easy-to-use registration system has been developed and implemented at various partering recycling companies.
                        This is to enable the ease of use for individuals wanting to register as waste pickers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon registration, the waste picker's details will be recorded into the database and they will receive their equipment,
                        consisting of a trolley, a large bag, and an optional card (bank card, or gift card). The waste pickers will receive
                        payment upon bringing in waste to the Collection Centre. This payment will be up to par with the current rates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The waste pickers are expected to collect waste from surrounding areas and then bringing their collected waste
                        to the Collection Centre closest to them. As mentioned, they will receive their payment here. The Collection
                        Centre will enable them to bring in waste more frequently since they will now be able to travel shorter
                        distances to get paid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The existing Collection Centres can be found <a href="locations.html">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Processing the waste</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the Collection Centre, the waste will be processed on site and then either collected by partnering recycling companies
                        or upcycled via South African communities.
                        On-site processing will be done via the unique smart bins at the Collection Centres. These smart bins are divided
                        into two compartments - an organic waste and recyclable waste compartment.
                    </p>

                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                            <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The organic waste compartment will be used to create compost from the organic waste in it via the hot composting process.
                        Hot composting was chosen due to it only taking 18 days to produce fine compost.
                        This compost will be made available to the surrounding communities to be used to fertilize their gardens. The
                        intention is to empower poor communities to create a higher quality of life for themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The recyclable waste compartment uses computer vision to identfy waste to ensure that the waste is indeed of the correct
                        type to be recycled. The amount of valid waste is what will be used to determine how much pay is due to the waste
                        picker that brought in the waste.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Upcycling</h2>
                    <p>
                        South Africa hosts many creative-thinking individuals that make a living from handmade crafts they sell to 
                        residents and tourists. These individuals make use of waste and turn it into a wide variety of products - such 
                        as brooms, rugs, toys, and even shadeports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The waste that cannot be composted or recycled will be made available for upcycling by surrounding communities. The 
                        waste will be kept at the Collection Centre in order for the community to have easy access to it. This will enable 
                        individuals to have more material at their disposal to create and earn more money - increasing their standard of 
                        living.
                    </p>
